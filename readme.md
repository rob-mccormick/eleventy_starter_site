# Eleventy Starter Site

This repo accompanies my blog post, [Getting Started With Eleventy](https://robmc.dev/blog/getting-started-with-eleventy).

In the article I go through the basics you need to know to set up your Eleventy project and build a basic portfolio site for Jimmy Jones, a monkey journalist. This is the code for the completed site.

## Development

### Install dependencies

After you clone the repo, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Working locally

Start the server and compile the site when you save changes:

```bash
npm start
```

### Creating a build

To create a production build (this is a simple site without processing or minifying):

```bash
npm run build
```
